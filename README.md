# Novel-Image-Captioning
Novel Image Captioning addresses the task of generating descriptions of novel objects which are
not present in paired image. Intrinsically, this task can reflect the generalization ability of models
in understanding and captioning the semantic meanings of visual concepts and objects unseen in
training set, sharing the similarity to one/zero-shot learning. 

In the project, I first build a basic CNN- RNN model and find it has poor performance in the task of Novel Image Captioning due
to lack of paired image. Then, inspired by the NOC model, I modify the original model and
conduct some evaluations(F1 score, CIDEr-D, METEOR, SPICE) and visualization.
